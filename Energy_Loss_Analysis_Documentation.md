# Energy Loss Analysis: Water Sloshing Energy Absorption Documentation

## ‚ö° Overview

This analysis quantifies how much mechanical energy is absorbed by water sloshing in spherical containers. By comparing dry balls (baseline) to water-filled balls, we can measure the exact percentage of energy that is converted from mechanical vibration to fluid motion.

## üî¨ Physics Background

### The Energy Conversion Process
When a water-filled ball is subjected to mechanical vibrations:

1. **Input Energy**: Mechanical vibration from the shaker
2. **Energy Distribution**: 
   - Some energy maintains the fundamental frequency
   - Some energy creates harmonics (higher frequencies)
   - Some energy is absorbed by water sloshing
3. **Output**: Reduced mechanical energy + increased fluid motion

### Why Energy Loss Occurs
- **Water sloshing**: Converts mechanical energy to fluid motion
- **Viscous damping**: Water viscosity dissipates energy as heat
- **Turbulence**: Chaotic water motion absorbs energy
- **Resonance effects**: Water creates its own oscillation modes

## üìä Experimental Methodology

### Baseline Comparison
- **Dry balls**: Reference energy level (no water sloshing)
- **Water balls**: Energy level with water sloshing effects
- **Energy loss %**: `(Dry Energy - Water Energy) / Dry Energy √ó 100`

### Energy Components Analyzed
1. **Total Energy**: Sum of all frequency components
2. **Fundamental Energy**: Energy at the base frequency
3. **Harmonic Energy**: Energy in higher frequency harmonics

## üéØ Expected Results and Interpretation

### Positive Energy Loss (0% to 100%)
- **Meaning**: Water absorbs mechanical energy
- **Physics**: Energy converted to water sloshing motion
- **Application**: Effective vibration damping

### Zero Energy Loss (0%)
- **Meaning**: No energy absorption by water
- **Physics**: Water doesn't affect the system
- **Application**: Ineffective damping

### Negative Energy Loss (-100% to 0%)
- **Meaning**: Water adds energy to the system
- **Physics**: Water sloshing amplifies vibrations
- **Application**: Energy amplification (undesirable for damping)

## üìà Chart Interpretation Guide

### Energy Loss Patterns

#### **Resonance Peaks**
- **High positive values**: Maximum energy absorption
- **Frequency**: Optimal damping frequency
- **Application**: Use this frequency for maximum damping

#### **Anti-Resonance Dips**
- **Negative values**: Energy amplification
- **Frequency**: Avoid this frequency
- **Physics**: Water sloshing amplifies vibrations

#### **Frequency Dependence**
- **Low frequencies**: Often show negative energy loss
- **Mid frequencies**: Transition from amplification to absorption
- **High frequencies**: Often show positive energy loss

### Water Content Effects

#### **Half Water vs Full Water**
- **Full water**: More dramatic effects (higher peaks, deeper dips)
- **Half water**: Smoother, more predictable behavior
- **Physics**: More water = stronger sloshing effects

#### **Ball Size Effects**
- **Small balls (10mm-30mm)**: Moderate energy loss (0-60%)
- **Medium balls (47.5mm-65mm)**: High energy loss (up to 90%)
- **Large balls (82.5mm-100mm)**: Extreme effects (negative to 100%)
