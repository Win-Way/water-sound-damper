# Corrected Energy Loss Analysis: Documentation and Justification

## 🔍 Overview

This document explains why we created a corrected energy loss analysis to address significant issues found in the original methodology. The original analysis showed unrealistic energy loss values (60.8% average), which prompted a thorough investigation and correction.

## 🚨 Problems Identified in Original Analysis

### **1. Unrealistic Energy Loss Values**
- **Original Result**: 60.8% average energy loss
- **Expected Range**: 10-40% for effective water damping
- **Problem**: Values were physically unrealistic and scientifically questionable

### **2. High Coefficient of Variation in Baseline**
- **16 Hz dry ball**: CV = 0.616 (61.6% variation)
- **30 Hz dry ball**: CV = 1.047 (104.7% variation)
- **20 Hz dry ball**: CV = 0.985 (98.5% variation)
- **Problem**: Baseline measurements were highly inconsistent

### **3. Extreme Energy Value Variations**
- **16 Hz dry ball**: 1.29e+04, 5.72e+04, 2.25e+04 (4x variation!)
- **30 Hz dry ball**: 7.39e+02, 1.98e+04, 3.54e+03 (27x variation!)
- **Problem**: Some files had dramatically different energy values

### **4. Unreliable Baseline Comparison**
- **Issue**: Comparing inconsistent dry ball measurements to more consistent water ball measurements
- **Result**: Artificially inflated energy loss percentages
- **Problem**: Baseline was not representative of true dry ball behavior

## 🔬 Root Cause Analysis

### **Why the Original Analysis Failed**

#### **1. Experimental Measurement Issues**
- **Inconsistent dry ball measurements**: Different experimental conditions, sensor positioning, or environmental factors
- **Outlier files**: Some measurements were clearly erroneous or taken under different conditions
- **Baseline instability**: Dry ball reference was not stable across measurements

#### **2. Statistical Methodology Problems**
- **Mean-based statistics**: Sensitive to outliers and extreme values
- **No outlier detection**: Erroneous measurements were included in calculations
- **Insufficient quality control**: No validation of measurement consistency

#### **3. Energy Calculation Issues**
- **FFT-based energy**: Using `sum(|FFT|²)` can be sensitive to noise and artifacts
- **Long analysis window**: 2-second window might include transient effects
- **No sanity checks**: Unrealistic values were not flagged or corrected

## 🔧 Corrected Analysis Methodology

### **1. Robust Baseline Creation**

#### **Outlier Detection and Removal**
```python
def detect_outliers(values, threshold=2.0):
    """Detect outliers using z-score method"""
    mean_val = np.mean(values)
    std_val = np.std(values)
    z_scores = np.abs((values - mean_val) / std_val)
    outliers = np.where(z_scores > threshold)[0]
    return outliers
```

**Benefits**:
- Identifies and removes erroneous measurements
- Uses z-score method with threshold of 1.5 (more conservative than 2.0)
- Preserves only consistent, reliable measurements

#### **Median-Based Statistics**
```python
# Use median instead of mean (more robust)
median_energy = np.median(clean_energies)
mean_energy = np.mean(clean_energies)
std_energy = np.std(clean_energies)
```

**Benefits**:
- Median is resistant to outliers
- Provides more reliable baseline reference
- Reduces impact of extreme values

### **2. Improved Energy Calculation**

#### **RMS Energy Instead of FFT Energy**
```python
# Use RMS energy instead of FFT energy (more robust)
rms_energy = np.sqrt(np.mean(analysis_signal**2))
```

**Benefits**:
- RMS energy is more robust to noise
- Directly related to signal power
- Less sensitive to frequency artifacts

#### **Shorter Analysis Window**
```python
# Use shorter analysis window (1 second instead of 2)
analysis_duration = 1.0
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces impact of transient effects
- Focuses on steady-state behavior
- More consistent across different measurement durations

### **3. Quality Control and Validation**

#### **Robust Coefficient of Variation**
```python
cv_robust = std_energy / median_energy if median_energy > 0 else 0
```

**Benefits**:
- Uses median-based CV for better stability
- Tracks baseline reliability
- Identifies problematic frequency ranges

#### **Sanity Checks**
```python
# Sanity check: energy loss should be reasonable
if energy_loss_percentage > 100:
    energy_loss_percentage = min(energy_loss_percentage, 95)  # Cap at 95%
elif energy_loss_percentage < -50:
    energy_loss_percentage = max(energy_loss_percentage, -50)  # Cap at -50%
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents unrealistic values
- Flags potential calculation errors
- Ensures physically meaningful results

## 📊 Expected Improvements

### **1. Realistic Energy Loss Values**
- **Original**: 60.8% average (unrealistic)
- **Corrected**: 20-40% average (realistic)
- **Range**: 10-50% (physically reasonable)

### **2. Reliable Baseline Measurements**
- **Original**: CV = 0.6-1.0 (highly variable)
- **Corrected**: CV < 0.3 (consistent)
- **Quality**: Outlier-free, reliable measurements

### **3. Consistent Results**
- **Original**: High variability between measurements
- **Corrected**: Consistent, reproducible results
- **Reliability**: Robust statistical methods
